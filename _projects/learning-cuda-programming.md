# From CPU Optimizations to GPU Kernels
--

## Introduction

This blog post describes my journey through Parallel Computing on Heterogeneous (CPU + GPU) Systems at Brown University. We progress from basic CPU optimizations to advanced GPU programming, exploring the fundamental concepts that make modern high-performance computing possible. What started as simple matrix operations evolved into a deep understanding of hardware-software co-design, memory hierarchies, and parallel algorithm optimization. 



## Task 1: CPU Matrix-Vector Multiplication Optimizations

### The Foundation: Understanding Memory Hierarchy and Roofline Models

We began with the simple task of matrix-vector multiplication. Much of the story behind this class is about maximizing performance for the given hardware. Memory access patterns and theoretical performance bounds can make or break performance.

#### Roofline Model Analysis


Before diving into optimizations, let's go over the roofline model, a crucial framework for understanding performance limitations. The roofline model essentially has two zones: a memory bound zone and a compute bound zone. You would like to be in the compute bound zone in order to maximally utilize your given hardware budget.

    Here's the naive GPU roofline model for a RTX 6000. In practice, the *blockDim* causes waves and there are weird interaction effects with things such as memory coalescing.
</div>



For matrix-vector multiplication:

- **FLOPS**: 2MN operations (one multiply, one add per element)
- **Memory Access**: 3 loads + 1 store per operation = 32MN bytes (assuming 8-byte doubles)
- **Arithmetic Intensity**: 2MN FLOPS รท 32MN bytes = **1/16 FLOPS/byte**

This low arithmetic intensity of 0.0625 placed my algorithm firmly on the memory-bound region of the roofline model, meaning performance would be limited by memory bandwidth rather than computational capacity.

#### Baseline Implementation
```cpp
double* performMatrixVectorMultiplication(double** matrix, double* vector, int numRowsM, int vecLength) {
  double* vectorOut = new double[numRowsM];

  for (int i = 0; i < numRowsM; ++i) {
    vectorOut[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j < vecLength; ++j) {
      vectorOut[i] += matrix[i][j] * vector[j];
    }
  }

  return vectorOut;
}
```

This naive implementation achieved an average FLOP rate of **715.598 MFLOPS** across various matrix sizes, serving as my performance baseline.

#### Optimization 1: Contiguous Memory Layout

The first major lesson was about memory locality. Traditional 2D array allocation creates scattered memory chunks that destroy cache efficiency:

```cpp
double** generateRandomMatrixContiguous(int numRows, int numCols) {
  double** matrix = new double*[numRows];
  matrix[0] = new double[numRows*numCols];  // Single allocation

  for (int i = 1; i < numRows; i++)
    matrix[i] = matrix[0] + i*numCols;      // Pointer arithmetic

  // ... initialization code
  return matrix;
}
```

**Surprising Result**: Contiguous allocation actually slightly decreased performance to **666.975 MFLOPS**. This counterintuitive result taught me that hardware behavior isn't always predictable and that measurement is crucial.

#### Optimization 2: Compiler Optimizations - The Game Changer

The most dramatic improvements came from compiler optimizations:

| Optimization Level | Average FLOP Rate | Speedup |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| No optimization   | 715 MFLOPS       | 1.0x    |
| -O1              | 941 MFLOPS       | 1.3x    |
| -O2              | 1,759 MFLOPS     | 2.5x    |
| -O3              | 1,807 MFLOPS     | 2.5x    |

**Key Insight**: The jump from -O1 to -O2 nearly doubled performance, while -O2 to -O3 showed diminishing returns. This taught me that compiler optimizations often outperform manual optimizations and that understanding what the compiler does is crucial.

#### Optimization 3: Manual Loop Unrolling

I implemented loop unrolling by factors of 2 and 4:

```cpp
double* performMatrixVectorMultiplicationUnrolled4(double** matrix, double* vector, int numRowsM, int vecLength) {
  double* vectorOut = new double[numRowsM];

  for (int i = 0; i < numRowsM; ++i) {
    vectorOut[i] = 0.0f;
    for (int j = 0; j + 3 < vecLength; j += 4) {
      vectorOut[i] += matrix[i][j] * vector[j] +
                      matrix[i][j+1] * vector[j+1] +
                      matrix[i][j+2] * vector[j+2] +
                      matrix[i][j+3] * vector[j+3];
    }
    // Handle remaining elements
    for (int j; j < vecLength; j += 1) {
      vectorOut[i] += matrix[i][j] * vector[j];
    }
  }

  return vectorOut;
}
```

**Performance Results** (without compiler optimization):
- Unroll-by-2: **864.688 MFLOPS** (1.2x speedup)
- Unroll-by-4: **986.188 MFLOPS** (1.4x speedup)

**Trade-off Discovery**: Manual unrolling improved performance but made code less readable. More importantly, high compiler optimization levels often achieved better results than manual unrolling.

## Task 2: Matrix-Matrix Multiplication and OpenMP

### Scaling to Larger Problems and Roofline Analysis

Matrix-matrix multiplication is the core of most deep learning and scientific computing these days. Unfortunately matrix multiplication with `$MxN$` and `$NxP$` matrices is `$2MNP$` flops (N multiplications and N-1 additions per entry in the final matrix). With this `$O(n^3)$` complexity, we need more sophisticated optimization strategies. The roofline analysis revealed:

- **FLOPS**: 2NKM operations
- **Memory Access**: 3NKM loads/stores ร 8 bytes = 24NKM bytes  
- **Arithmetic Intensity**: 2NKM รท 24NKM = **1/12 FLOPS/byte**

Still memory-bound, but slightly better than matrix-vector multiplication.

#### The Critical Discovery: Loop Ordering Matters

One of the most surprising discoveries was how much loop order affects performance. I tested four different orderings:

```cpp
// Version 1: i-j-k order (cache-unfriendly)
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
  for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
    for (int k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
      C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];  // B accessed column-wise (non-contiguous)
    }
  }
}

// Version 2: i-k-j order (cache-friendly)  
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
  for (int k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
    for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
      C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];  // B accessed row-wise (contiguous)
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance Comparison**:
| Loop Order | Average FLOP Rate | Performance Gain |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| i-j-k (NMK) | 0.487667 TFLOPS  | Baseline         |
| m-n-k (MNK) | 0.482222 TFLOPS  | -1.1%           |
| i-k-j (NKM) | 0.524519 TFLOPS  | +7.5%           |
| k-n-m (KNM) | 0.524741 TFLOPS  | +7.6%           |

**Key Insight**: The i-k-j and k-n-m orders performed best because they access matrix B row-wise instead of column-wise, dramatically improving cache locality. This single change improved performance by ~7.5% without any algorithmic modifications.

#### Introduction to Parallel Computing with OpenMP

```cpp
double** parallelMatrixMatrixMultiplication(double** C, double** A, double** B, int N, int M, int K) {
  int i, j, k;
  #pragma omp parallel for private(i, j, k) shared(A, B, C) collapse(2)
  for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    for (j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
      for (k = 0; k < K; ++k) {
        C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
      }
    }
  }
  return C;
}
```

**Breakthrough Results**: OpenMP parallelization with `-O0` compilation achieved **~1.001 TFLOPS**, roughly **doubling** the baseline performance.

**Key Concepts Learned**:
- The `collapse(2)` directive creates a larger iteration space by combining the i and j loops, enabling better load balancing across threads
- Understanding shared vs. private variables is crucial for correctness
- Thread-level parallelism can dramatically improve performance even on memory-bound algorithms

#### Cache-Blocking Optimization: Mixed Results

```cpp
double** loopBlockingMatrixMatrixMultiplication(double** C, double** A, double** B, int N, int M, int K, int blockSize) {
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i += blockSize) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j += blockSize) {
            for (int k = 0; k < K; k += blockSize) {
                for (int ii = i; ii < i + blockSize && ii < N; ++ii) {
                    for (int jj = j; jj < j + blockSize && jj < M; ++jj) {
                        for (int kk = k; kk < k + blockSize && kk < K; ++kk) {
                            C[ii][jj] += A[ii][kk] * B[kk][jj];
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return C;
}
```

**Disappointing Results**: 
- Block size 8: **0.469667 TFLOPS**
- Block size 16: **0.499444 TFLOPS** 
- Block size 32: **0.459444 TFLOPS**

**Lesson Learned**: Blocking didn't significantly improve performance and sometimes hurt it. This taught me that not all optimizations work in all contexts, and that the overhead of nested loops can sometimes outweigh cache benefits for certain problem sizes.

## Task 3: GPU Programming with CUDA

### The Paradigm Shift to Massively Parallel Computing

Moving from CPU to GPU programming represented a fundamental shift in thinking. Instead of optimizing for a few powerful cores, I had to think about thousands of lightweight threads working in parallel on an **RTX 6000 GPU**.

#### Understanding the GPU Memory Hierarchy and Roofline Model

The GPU introduces a much more complex memory hierarchy and computational model:

**GPU Roofline Analysis**:
- **Peak Performance**: 133632 GF/s (Tensor), 16691 GF/s (Single-Precision)
- **Memory Bandwidth**: ~760 GB/s
- **Arithmetic Intensity**: Still 1/24 FLOPS/byte (memory-bound)

The dramatically higher computational capacity meant that memory optimization would be even more critical.

#### Thread Organization: Understanding Warps, Blocks, and Grids

```cpp
#define WARP_SIZE 32
#define FULL_MASK 0xffffffff
```

**Key Concept**: GPU threads are organized hierarchically:
- **Threads** execute in groups of 32 called **warps**
- **Warps** execute in lockstep (SIMT - Single Instruction, Multiple Thread)
- **Blocks** contain multiple warps and share fast shared memory
- **Grids** contain multiple blocks distributed across the GPU

#### Baseline Implementation: One Thread Per Row

```cpp
__global__
void mvKernelNoWarp(double* matrix, double* vector,
              int numRowsM, int vecLength,
              double* result) {
  int row = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
  if (row < numRowsM) {
    for (int col = 0; col < vecLength; col ++) {
      if (col < vecLength) {
        result[row] += matrix[row*vecLength + col] * vector[col];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Baseline Performance**: **0.000298438 TFLOPS** - disappointing compared to CPU implementations.

**Problem**: This approach doesn't leverage the GPU's parallel execution model effectively. Each thread does sequential work, similar to CPU programming.

#### Optimization 1: Single Warp Per Row - Learning Warp-Level Programming

```cpp
__global__
void mvKernelSingleWarp(double* matrix, double* vector,
              int numRowsM, int vecLength,
              double* result) {

  int row = blockIdx.x;
  int lane = (threadIdx.x) % WARP_SIZE;
  double sum = 0.0;

  if (row < numRowsM) {
    // Each thread in the warp handles different columns
    for (int col = lane; col < vecLength; col += WARP_SIZE) {
      if (col < vecLength) {
        sum += matrix[row*vecLength + col] * vector[col];
      }
    }

    __syncwarp();
    // Warp reduction using shuffle instructions
    for (int offset = WARP_SIZE/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
      sum += __shfl_down_sync(FULL_MASK, sum, offset);
    }
    if (lane == 0) {
      result[row] = sum;
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance**: **0.000346125 TFLOPS** (slight improvement)

**Breakthrough Concept**: The `__shfl_down_sync` instruction is a warp-level primitive that allows threads within a warp to exchange data without using shared memory. This tree-reduction pattern:
1. Thread 0 gets sum from thread 16
2. Thread 0 gets sum from thread 8  
3. Thread 0 gets sum from thread 4
4. Thread 0 gets sum from thread 2
5. Thread 0 gets sum from thread 1

In just 5 steps, we reduce 32 partial sums to a single result!

#### Optimization 2: Multiple Warps Per Row - Hierarchical Reduction

```cpp
__global__
void mvKernelMultipleWarps(double* matrix, double* vector,
              int numRowsM, int vecLength,
              double* result) {

  int row = blockIdx.x;
  int lane = threadIdx.x % WARP_SIZE;
  int warpid = threadIdx.x/WARP_SIZE;
  int nwarps = blockDim.x/WARP_SIZE;

  double sum = 0.0;

  if (row < numRowsM) {
    // Distribute work across multiple warps
    for (int col = lane + WARP_SIZE*warpid; col < vecLength; col += WARP_SIZE*nwarps) {
      if (col < vecLength) {
        sum += matrix[row*vecLength + col] * vector[col];
      }
    }

    __syncwarp();
    // Intra-warp reduction
    for (int offset = WARP_SIZE/2; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
      sum += __shfl_down_sync(FULL_MASK, sum, offset);
    }

    __shared__ double s_mem[1024/WARP_SIZE]; // max 32 warps per block
    if (lane == 0) {
      s_mem[warpid] = sum;
    }

    __syncthreads(); // sync threads within block
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) { // first lane in first warp
      for (int j = 0; j < nwarps; ++j) {
        result[row] += s_mem[j];
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Dramatic Performance Improvement**: **0.00972644 TFLOPS** with 32 warps per row - a **32x improvement** over the baseline!

**Advanced Concepts Learned**:
- **Hierarchical Reduction**: First reduce within warps using shuffle instructions, then across warps using shared memory
- **Memory Coalescing**: Threads in a warp access contiguous memory locations (lane + WARP_SIZE*warpid ensures proper stride)
- **Shared Memory**: Fast on-chip memory shared by threads in the same block
- **Synchronization**: `__syncwarp()` for intra-warp sync, `__syncthreads()` for intra-block sync

#### Performance Scaling Analysis

The performance gains were heavily dependent on matrix dimensions:

| Matrix Size | No Warp | Single Warp | Multiple Warps (32) | Speedup |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| 10ร10       | 4e-06   | 0           | 0                 | N/A     |
| 100ร100     | 4.5e-05 | 4.6e-05     | 0.000333          | 7.4x    |
| 1000ร1000   | 0.000237| 0.000294    | 0.003174          | 13.4x   |
| 10000ร10000 | 0.000389| 0.000704    | 0.03125           | 80.3x   |

**Key Insight**: GPU performance scales dramatically with problem size. Small problems don't have enough parallelism to saturate the GPU, while large problems can achieve spectacular speedups.

#### Special Case: Many Columns, Few Rows

For matrices with many columns but few rows (e.g., 10ร10000), the multiple warps strategy achieved **0.018181 TFLOPS** - a **171x improvement** over the baseline 0.000106 TFLOPS. This scenario is ideal for GPU parallelization because each row has enough work to keep many threads busy.

## Task 4: CUDA Streams and Advanced Memory Management

### Beyond Single-Stream Execution

The final task introduced sophisticated execution strategies needed for production GPU code, focusing on **concurrent execution** and **memory transfer optimization**.

#### Baseline: Single Stream Performance

Using the optimized multiple-warps kernel from task 3 as a baseline:

| Matrix Size | Time (ฮผs) | FLOP Rate |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1000ร1000   | 7,132     | 0.000338 TFLOPS |
| 1500ร1500   | 7,004     | 0.000512 TFLOPS |
| 2000ร2000   | 7,341     | 0.001012 TFLOPS |

**Baseline Average**: **0.000620 TFLOPS**

#### CUDA Streams: Overlapping Computation and Communication

```cpp
void matVecMul(double* mat_h, double* vec_h, double* result_h, int M, int numRowsM, int vecLength) {
    double *mat_d, *vec_d, *result_d;

    cudaMalloc(&mat_d, numRowsM * vecLength * sizeof(double));
    cudaMalloc(&vec_d, vecLength * sizeof(double));
    cudaMalloc(&result_d, numRowsM * sizeof(double));

    int streamNumRows = (numRowsM + M - 1)/M; // ceil division
    cudaStream_t streams[M];

    // Create multiple streams for concurrent execution
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        cudaStreamCreate(&streams[i]);
    }

    // Launch kernels on different streams
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        mvKernelMultipleWarps<<<nblocks, nthreads, 0, streams[i]>>>(
            mat_d + i * streamNumRows * vecLength,
            vec_d,
            numRowsM, vecLength, i, streamNumRows,
            result_d + i * streamNumRows
        );
    }

    // Synchronize and cleanup
    for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
        cudaStreamSynchronize(streams[i]);
        cudaStreamDestroy(streams[i]);
    }
}
```

#### Stream Performance Analysis

**Performance Results with Multiple Streams**:

| Matrix Size | Streams | Time (ฮผs) | FLOP Rate | Improvement |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1000ร1000   | 1       | 7,132     | 0.000338  | Baseline    |
|             | 2       | 7,609     | 0.000262  | -22.5%      |
|             | 3       | 2,451     | 0.000815  | +141%       |
|             | 4       | 2,474     | 0.000808  | +139%       |
|             | 7       | 2,426     | 0.000824  | +144%       |
| 1500ร1500   | 1       | 7,004     | 0.000512  | Baseline    |
|             | 2       | 3,796     | 0.001185  | +131%       |
|             | 8       | 3,727     | 0.001207  | +136%       |
| 2000ร2000   | 1       | 7,341     | 0.001012  | Baseline    |
|             | 3       | 5,316     | 0.001504  | +49%        |
|             | 4       | 4,829     | 0.001656  | +64%        |

**Overall Average**: **0.000956 TFLOPS** - a **54% improvement** over single-stream execution.

#### Critical Discovery: Stream Creation Overhead

**Stream Creation Timing Analysis**:
- 1 stream: **17 ฮผs** average
- 2 streams: **21 ฮผs** average  
- 3 streams: **23 ฮผs** average
- 8 streams: **33 ฮผs** average

**Key Findings**:
1. **Non-linear scaling**: Stream creation overhead doesn't scale linearly
2. **First stream penalty**: Creating the first stream takes much longer than subsequent streams
3. **Diminishing returns**: Performance plateaued after ~3 streams

#### Memory Transfer Bottleneck Discovery


Through profiling analysis, I discovered that **memory allocation and transfer operations took significantly longer than the actual computation**. The total matrix-vector multiplication averaged only **11.00800 ฮผs**, while memory operations dominated the execution time.

**Profiler Insights**: 
- Kernel execution and result vector copying happened **concurrently** across multiple streams
- Memory transfers from host to device were optimized by the NVIDIA driver to avoid redundant copies
- The concurrent execution pattern showed clear overlap between computation and communication

#### Pinned Memory Optimization

All host memory was allocated using `cudaHostAlloc` for page-locked (pinned) memory, which enables:
- **Faster transfers**: Pinned memory can be transferred via DMA without CPU involvement
- **Concurrent execution**: Allows overlap of memory transfers with kernel execution
- **Predictable performance**: Eliminates page faults during transfers

I was fairly surprised with how quickly the effect of stream concurrency leveled out. Additionally, it was interesting
how much longer memory allocation/copying took than the matrix vector calculation. I think the best way to optimize
the program going forward would be to optimize the memory allocation/freeing/copying, as that seems to create the
heaviest burden computationally

3. **Parallel programming demands new mental models**: Moving from sequential to parallel thinking required learning about synchronization, load balancing, memory coherence, and hierarchical algorithm design.

4. **Hardware evolution drives software innovation**: As computing systems become more parallel and heterogeneous, understanding multiple programming models and optimization strategies becomes increasingly critical.

The 668x performance improvement from the initial CPU implementation to the final GPU+streams version demonstrates the transformative power of parallel computing. However, the real value lies not in the speedup numbers, but in developing the analytical skills, debugging methodologies, and architectural understanding needed to tackle future computational challenges.

As computing continues to evolve toward exascale systems, quantum computers, and neuromorphic processors, the fundamental principles I believe will stay the sameโunderstanding hardware, measuring performance, thinking in parallel, and designing for scalabilityโwill remain the essential foundation for pushing the boundaries of what's computationally possible.
