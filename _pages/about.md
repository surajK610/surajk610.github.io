This is my personal blog. I mainly make blog posts that explain ideas that are interesting to me. Many of these ideas happen to be in the realm of modern machine learning, but they are not limited to this. Please contact me if you have anything that you think is worth covering, I am always open to thinking about new perspectives!

I am a 2024 graduate of [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) with an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science. I am interested in (1) solving complex engineering problems and (2) exploring fascinating mathematic/scientific ideas. My goal is to build algorithms that learn how to do useful things and are aligned with human values. I currently work as a Quantitative Researcher at [Point72](https://point72.com/) focused on using NLP research methods to find signal. I previously conducted research in the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) focused on learning dynamics of in context learning, investigating compositionality using causal interventions methods, mechanistic interpretability, and reinforcement learning from human feedback with Dr. Ellie Pavlick. I have previously collaborated with EleutherAI.
